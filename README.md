# Affordable Housing Service

Our application simplifies the process for Landlords and Property Developers that want to
provide housing for tenants who qualify for the Housing Choice Voucher Program.

This application was developed on the weekend of February 6th-8th, 2015 for the
[Zillow Hack Housing hackathon](http://www.zillow.com/wikipages/Hack-Housing-Empowering-Smarter-Decisions-Contest/).
